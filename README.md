Real-Time Chat Application 💬
The Real-Time Chat Application is a lightweight, interactive web-based chat platform built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Socket.IO. This project enables multiple users to send and receive messages in real time with a simple, clean user interface.

Created by Nuthalapati Harshitha, this application is designed as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate how real-time web communication works using WebSockets. Whether you're learning about event-driven architecture, or building a foundation for a more advanced messaging system, this chat app is a perfect starting point.

📌 Overview
This chat application allows users to enter their name and send messages to a shared chat room. When a message is sent, it's instantly broadcast to all connected clients without needing to refresh the page. This functionality is made possible by Socket.IO, which enables real-time, bi-directional communication between the client and server using WebSockets under the hood.

⚙️ Features
Real-time Messaging: Messages are sent and received instantly across all connected clients.

Username Support: Each user can enter their name to identify who sent which message.

Simple and Clean UI: Designed with a responsive layout for easy usage on any device.

Efficient DOM Updates: New messages are dynamically appended to the chat area without refreshing the page.

Scalable Foundation: Easily extend this project with features like private rooms, user lists, emojis, and more.

🧱 Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the user interface elements like inputs and message display areas.

CSS3: For styling and layout design, ensuring a clean and modern appearance.

JavaScript (Vanilla): For handling form submissions, capturing user inputs, and interacting with the DOM.

Socket.IO: Enables real-time, full-duplex communication between the client and server.
